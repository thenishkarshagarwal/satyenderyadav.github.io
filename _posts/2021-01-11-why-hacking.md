maybe you want to hack into your neighbors' wifi?
<br>
OMG! FREE Wi-Fi FOR LYF!
<br>
<br>
or you want to hack the bank and fill your account with _$$$_.
<br>
**PS**: if you choose the above reasons, then **GROW UP**!
<br>
you probably chose the wrong road. **this blog is NOT for you**.
<br>
<br>
well, this can also be something that drives you off.
<br>
or because you want to make internet a safer place [god no!]
<br>
or because you care for the betterment of Information Security.
<br>
<br>
coz hacking is not a two days' game. **you need to have some patience.**
<br>
<br>
if you have a lack of motivation and desire to learn, then your infosec career **ends** here.
<br>
because youâ€™re not going to get far. no one can/will spoon-feed you everything.
<br>
<br>
**YOU HAVE TO BECOME A SELF LEARNER**.
