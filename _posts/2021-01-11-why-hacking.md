maybe you want to hack into your neighbors' wifi?
<br>
OMG! FREE Wi-Fi FOR LYF!
<br>
<br>
or you want to hack the bank and fill your account with _$$$_.
<br>
<br>
**PS**: if you choose the above "or similar **unethical**" reasons, then **GROW UP**!
<br>
you probably chose the wrong road. **this blog is NOT for you**.
<br>
<br>
well, this can also be something that drives you off.
<br>
or because you want to make internet a safer place [god no!]
<br>
or because you care for the betterment of Information Security.
<br>
<br>
coz hacking is not a two days' game. **you need to have some patience.**
<br>
if so, read ahead, and i'll help you with the skills.
<br>
<br>
if you have a lack of motivation and desire to learn, then your infosec career **ends** here.
<br>
because youâ€™re not going to get far. no one can/will spoon-feed you everything.
<br>
<br>
**YOU HAVE TO BECOME A SELF LEARNER**.
<br>
_[& GOOGLE is your best friend here ;]_
<br>
<br>
SO LET'S GET STARTED!
<br>
<br>
first things first, you should know what you are willing to struggle for.
<br>
i.e. here's a **roadmap** of all the things you should know to become a *__1337 h4x0r__*.
<br>
- typing skills [TOUCH TYPING]
- command line skills [cmd, console, terminal, powershell, etc]
- networking skills
- familiarity with OSs & distributions [OFC!]
- programming skills
- reading interest [read a lot of books]
<br>

well before that, you should know that you can learn everything, but can't master everything.
<br>
so, you should master a specific area WELL, & get good at it.
<br>
i.e. convert it into a high-level skill.
<br>
<br>
so, according to me, JUST a 'hacker' doesn't exist.
<br>
but if you learn everything on the roadmap,
<br>
you will know there are some things which interests you more than others.
<br>
<br>
