maybe you want to hack into your neighbors' wifi?

OMG! FREE Wi-Fi FOR LYF!


or you want to hack the bank and fill your account with _$$$_.

**PS**: if you choose the above reasons, then **GROW UP**!

you probably chose the wrong road. **this blog is NOT for you**.


well, this can also be something that drives you off.

or because you want to make internet a safer place [god no!]

or because you care for the betterment of Information Security.


coz hacking is not a two days' game. **you need to have some patience.**


if you have a lack of motivation and desire to learn, then your infosec career **ends** here.

because youâ€™re not going to get far. no one can/will spoon-feed you everything.


**YOU HAVE TO BECOME A SELF LEARNER**.
