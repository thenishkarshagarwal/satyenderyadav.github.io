**NOTE: IF YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS, THAN THIS ARTICLE IS FOR YOU.**
<br>
<br>
maybe you want to hack into your neighbors' wifi?
<br>
OMG! FREE Wi-Fi FOR LYF!
<br>
<br>
or you want to hack the bank and fill your account with _$$$_.
<br>
<br>
**PS**: if you choose the above "or similar **unethical**" reasons, then **GROW UP**!
<br>
you probably chose the wrong road. **this blog is NOT for you**.
<br>
<br>
well, this can also be something that drives you off.
<br>
or because you want to make internet a safer place [god no!]
<br>
or because you care for the betterment of Information Security.
<br>
<br>
coz hacking is not a two days' game. **you need to have some patience.**
<br>
if so, read ahead, and i'll help you with the skills.
<br>
<br>
if you have a lack of motivation and desire to learn, then your infosec career **ends here**.
<br>
because youâ€™re not going to get far. no one can/will spoon-feed you everything.
<br>
<br>
**YOU HAVE TO BECOME A SELF LEARNER**.
<br>
_[& GOOGLE is your best friend here ;]_
<br>
<br>
SO LET'S GET STARTED!
<br>
<br>
first things first, you should know what you are willing to struggle for.
<br>
i.e. here's a **roadmap** of all the things you should know to become a *__1337 h4x0r__*.
<br>
- typing skills [TOUCH TYPING]
- basic computer skills [a+ practical]
- command line skills [cmd, powershell, terminal]
- networking skills
- programming skills
<br>

well before that, you should know that **you can learn everything, but can't master everything.**
<br>
so, you should master a specific area WELL, & get good at it.
<br>
<br>
so, according to me, JUST a 'hacker' doesn't exist.
<br>
but if you learn everything on the roadmap [critical skills],
<br>
you will know that there are some things which interests you more than others.
<br>
<br>
and after finding that, start focusing on them,
<br>
because **doing something you don't like, is time wasted.**
<br>
<br>
PS: if you don't need resources at the moment, you can leave.
<br>
<br>

### #1 PRACTICE TOUCH TYPING
<br>
the first and the foremost thing to do, is to master the keyboard,
<br>
so you can quickly put in all you commands, and save a lot of time.
<br>
<br>

[typing.com](typing.com); one of the best websites I found online, to practice and master touch-typing.
<br>
[keybr.com](keybr.com); one of the best websites to practice typing.
<br>
#### TIPS;
- at first, you'll be very uncomfortable with it,
<br>
but make a habit to type atleast an hour or half & stick to it.
- after being a bit comfortable, start using it everywhere.
<br>
remember you will be pretty slow at that time, but don't quit.
- don't focus on the speed, but rather on the mistakes/typos,
<br>
coz you'll make a lot of typos in the starting,
<br>
so, typing slowly & making less mistakes > typing fast with more mistakes.
- you'll gradually notice that your typing speed increases over time,
<br>
kudos to you, you did it.
<br>
<br>

### #2 COMMAND LINE SKILLS
<br>
now this one is even more important, and comes gradually from experience.
<br>
you need to get your hands set, as this is where you'll be spending most of your time.
<br>
<br>

[linuxjourney.com](linuxjourney.com); a great way to learn the basic terminal commands with quizzes & exercises.
<br>
PS: just pull out a cheat-sheet, install a linux distro & start learning.
<br>
<br>
this is how we all learn, we are humans. google each term, and know about them.
<br>
or maybe, read some books, watch some video courses, experiment & find out.
<br>
_[just look into the command-prompt, & powershell  the same way]_
<br>
<br>
### #2 NETWORKING SKILLS
<br>

you need networking, _you really do_. _atleast a bit_.
<br>
go through these blog posts, and the videos below, and that's more than enough.

### #3 TOOLS
<br>
now this is very important, this is where things start changing.
<br>
bluntly learning the tools' syntax will make you a script kiddie,  
<br>
<br>
so you gotta learn all those tools [below],
<br>
and most importantly, learn how they work.
<br>
<br>

- Wireshark (Wireless Auditing)
- Metasploit Framework (msfconsole)
- Nmap (Network Mapper)
- Nessus (Vulnerability Scanner)
- Aircrack-ng Suite (Wifi Cracking)
- John The Ripper (Password Cracking)
- Hydra (password cracker)
- Nikto (Network Scanner)
- NetDiscover (IP Discover)
- Hashcat (Password Cracker)
- BurpSuite (Web Exploitation)
<br>
<br>
### #3 PROGRAMMING SKILLS
<br>
the top 3 programing languages [a must to learn];
<br>
<br>

- JavaScript
- Python
- C/C++
<br>

START with these languages, **DON'T STOP LEARNING PROGRAMMING**.
<br>
just START learning it, and hacking too [side-by-side];
<br>
and on your way, it's time to **solve some ctf challs and root some boxes**.
<br>
[ik you're still a beginner in programming, & that's completely okay]
<br>
<br>
oh! so you need resources to help you get started?
<br>
huhh! as if you think i'll provide you. don't you remember what i said earlier?
<br>
<br>

> [& GOOGLE is your best friend here ;]

<br>

> this is how we all learn, we are humans. google each term, follow some tutorials.
> or maybe, read some books, watch some video courses, experiment & find out.

<br>
<br>
### #4 NEXT STEPS
<br>

at the end, I would like to conclude that this was my way of learning,
<br>
and yours could be **totally different, correct** & **efficient** at the very same time.
<br>
so simply, **ALWAYS KEEP LEARNING**.
<br>
and have a great day ahead.
