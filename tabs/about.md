First and foremost, I am **human**. If you need someone to listen, don't hesitate to write me.

I am a software developer. This blog will focus primarily on my personal programming-related interests, including systems programming, operating systems, programming languages, and reverse engineering.

I am gay, and suffer from social anxiety. I hope that my openness can help to normalize honesty and compassion in this industry for everyone.
